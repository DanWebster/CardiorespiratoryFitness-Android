<!--<h1>About the Heart Snapshot</h1>-->
<!--</p>-->

<p>
    Do not take your resting heart rate within one to two hours after exercise or a stressful event. Your heart rate can stay elevated after strenuous activities.
</p>

<p>
    Wait at least an hour after consuming caffeine, which can cause heart palpitations and make your heart rate rise.
</p>

<p>
    The American Heart Association recommends checking your resting heart rate first thing in the morning (but before you get out of bed).
